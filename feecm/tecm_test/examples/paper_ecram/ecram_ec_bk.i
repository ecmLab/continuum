# ECRAM Device Simulation - Horizontal Simplified
# 3-terminal side-gated device with Li+ intercalation into 2D heterostructure
# Left: Gate electrode, Middle: Electrolyte, Right: 2D channel material
# Only intercalation at electrolyte/channel interface

## Physical Parameters
# Gate bias (voltage-driven like working model)
V_gate = 2.0  # V (positive for Li+ intercalation)

# PEO electrolyte properties
sigma_e = 1e-5    # S/m (ionic conductivity in 1wt%LiClO4-PEO electrolyte)
c_Li_e = 110      # mol/m^3 (Li+ concentration in electrolyte, LiClO4 is very dilute)
D_Li = 2.4e-14    # m^2/s (Li+ diffusivity in electrolyte, based on Nernst-Einstein relation)

# 2D material properties
sigma_c = 1e6    # S/m (electronic conductivity of graphene)
c_Li_c = 10       # mol/m^3 (Li+ concentration in channel initially)
#sigma_c = 10    # S/m (electronic conductivity of MoS2)
#c_max = 30000     # mol/m^3 (maximum Li+ intercalation capacity in C, LiC6)
#c_max = 60000    # mol/m^3 (maximum Li+ intercalation capacity in MoS2, Li1MoS2)

# Intercalation kinetics
i0 = 1e-4         # A/m^2 (exchange current density for intercalation)
alpha = 0.5       # charge transfer coefficient
U_eq = 0.1       # V (equilibrium potential)

# Physical constants
R = 8.314         # J/(molÂ·K)
T = 300           # K
F = 96485         # C/mol

# Geometry (simplified 2D cross-section)
# Gate model is ignored as the gate is just the electron source
#L_gate = 2e-7     # m (gate thickness)
L_elyte = 1e-7     # m (electrolyte thickness)
L_channel = 2e-7  # m (channel thickness - 2D material)
t_device = 5e-7    # m (device height)
