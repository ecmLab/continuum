# Moose tests for Plasticity and Electro-Chemo-Mechanics

This repository provides a set of simple tests for learning and using the electro-chemo-mech repository using MOOSE
Documentation is ongoing and will be updated daily 

Currently the following tests are in place 

1. Single Element test for (Narayanan and Anand (2018, 2019) plasticity models)
2. Full tension and compression tests for (Narayanan and Anand (2018, 2019) plasticity models)
3. Unidirectional swelling tests (Narayanan and Anand 2020)
    1. Mechanical only swelling test (concentration is input as constant value)
    2. Fully coupled electro-chemo-mech test with mortar contact and gap conductance with scaling for concentration.
